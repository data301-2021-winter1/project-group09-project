## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{With the project we're hoping that we can provide a more meaningful insight into the startup up world in India and hopefully use that information to help investors make more intelligent decisions. We are interested in this dataset as it as we are firstly, Management and Economics students. Secondly, the start-up world is very confusing and oversaturated giving new investors a distorted image of what is actually happening in the ecosystem. Cleaning up this data and answering questions similar to the following would help us do that: Which cities does the most funding come from? Which industries have the most successful funding rounds? which startup industry or city reaches the furthest funding round? Answering these questions will also help build a use-facing interface which will be useful to them.}

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{This dataset was uploaded to Kaggle by someone interested in the startup ecosystem in India, with data mostly colleced from the website trak.in. This dataset includes things like the start up company's industry, the sub-indsutry, where it is located, the amount invested, type of investment and who invested in the company. The data collected ranges from 2015 to mid 2017. The purpose of this dataset was to study how startups are funded and who funds them in India, along with how much money is put into them. This should then give the person looking at it, some insight on where indsutries are on the life cycle (introduction, growth, peak, decline). It also allows the viewer to understand the numbers much easier since the funding column has been converted into USD. The data collected was done, we are assuming, through partly manual input and partlyh through combining information found on trak.in.}
