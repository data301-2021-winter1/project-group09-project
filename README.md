## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

With the project I'm hoping that I can provide a more meaningful insight into the startup up world in India and hopefully use that information to help rookies in the start-up world make more intelligent decisions. I am interested in this dataset as I am a Management student. Secondly, the start-up world is very confusing and oversaturated giving new entrants a distorted image of what is actually happening in the ecosystem and how to take the first step. Cleaning up this data and answering questions similar to the following would help us do that: How many start-ups exist in each city, what is the most popular industry vertical, when did new entrants usually enter the industry, which city has the most funding and which investment type brings in the most amount of funding.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset was uploaded to Kaggle by someone interested in the startup ecosystem in India, with data mostly colleced from the website trak.in. This dataset includes things like the start up company's industry, the sub-indsutry, where it is located, the amount invested, type of investment and who invested in the company. The data collected ranges from 2015 to mid 2017. The purpose of this dataset was to study how startups are funded and who funds them in India, along with how much money is put into them. This should then give the person looking at it, some insight on where indsutries are on the life cycle (introduction, growth, peak, decline). It also allows the viewer to understand the numbers much easier since the funding column has been converted into USD. The data collected was done, we are assuming, through partly manual input and partlyh through combining information found on trak.in.
